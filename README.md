# Motion and Control of Spherical Robot
* Numerical simulation written in python to express the motion of a spherical robot by modelling its dynamics via a Hamiltonian equations of motion.

* Corresponding differential equations will be discretized in a way which preserves the geometric structure of the motion dynamics and generates minimum error trajectories given a set of initial conditions.
